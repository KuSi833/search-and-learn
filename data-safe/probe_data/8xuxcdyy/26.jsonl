So, there are $4\\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.\n\nCase 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three.
